## ‚öôÔ∏è Software Setup for Product

1. Mount the physical product at the top of the back wall, ensuring the camera has a clear view of the full room.
2. Set `SHOW_STATIONARY_BOXES = True` and `SHOW_FLOOR_ZONE_BOXES = True`.
3. Define your `Floor_Zones` based on the coordinates of the stationary boxes.
4. Once floor zones are confirmed, set `SHOW_STATIONARY_BOXES = False`.
5. Check the placement of your floor zones and adjust coordinates as needed.
6. Implement code to link each zone‚Äôs ON/OFF status to your designated lights.
7. Consider adding a timer to keep lights on for a fixed duration (this may be included in a future version).
8. Once configured, you can **Set and Forget**.

## üî© Requirements to Create the Physical Product

To replicate the hardware:

1. A Raspberry Pi (we used a Raspberry Pi 4).
2. Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2.
3. Access to a 3D printer to print a shell/enclosure for the Pi and Camera.
4. Any necessary hardware components for controlling your lights (relays, smart plugs, etc.).

## üí° Why Use This Product?

- Automatically detects presence and activity zones in a room.
- Helps reduce unnecessary energy usage by activating lights only when needed.
- Fully customizable zones and logic.
- Easily integrable with smart home systems.
- Set it up once, and it runs autonomously.
